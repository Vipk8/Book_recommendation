Overview
This project implements a Book Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques. The system is designed to suggest books to users based on their past preferences and interactions. It leverages cosine similarity to find relationships between books and users, providing personalized recommendations.

Features
User-Based Recommendations: Suggests books based on user preferences.
Cosine Similarity Scoring: Calculates similarity between users and books for recommendations.
Interactive Recommendations: Provides a tailored experience by utilizing user and rating data.
Datasets
The model uses three datasets:

Users Dataset:

Contains user information (e.g., user IDs, demographics).
Example columns: User_ID, Age, Location.
Ratings Dataset:

Includes user ratings for books.
Example columns: User_ID, Book_ID, Rating.
Books Dataset:

Details about the books in the system.
Example columns: Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Merged datasets based on User_ID and Book_ID.
Handled missing data and standardized the format.
Cosine Similarity:

The similarity score between users or books is calculated using cosine similarity:
Cosine Similarity
=
Dot Product of Vectors
Magnitude of Vectors
Cosine Similarity= 
Magnitude of Vectors
Dot Product of Vectors
​
 
Used to measure the closeness of user preferences and book attributes.
Recommendation Engine:

Based on the cosine similarity scores, the system identifies books similar to a user's preferences or highly rated by similar users.
Libraries and Tools
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For mathematical computations.
scikit-learn: For implementing cosine similarity.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data and similarity scores.
